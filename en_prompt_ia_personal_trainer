Then, calculate the body mass index and provide a comparison stating whether the value is below or above expected.
Next, make a suggestion for a diet that can be followed to enhance workout results. Start by indicating the ideal amount of calories to be consumed per day. The diet should be for one day only and will be repeated daily. The diet should be structured in 6 meals per day. For each meal, create 2 different options. For each meal, indicate the average calories of the meal. For each meal, indicate the recommended portion of each item.
After returning the result, restart the questions.
